## About Me
Hi, I'm Holly Briggs, a software engineering student! 

As a Software Engineering student with a 4.0 GPA at BYU-Idaho, I am passionate about coding, problem-solving, and creating user-friendly software. With a background in UI/UX design and graphic design from my early career at Novell and Utah Valley University, I bring a unique blend of technical and creative skills to software development.

My expertise includes Python, C#, JavaScript, MySQL, HTML, and CSS, along with a strong foundation in software testing, databases, and web development. I have hands-on experience with tools like VS Code, GitHub, MySQL Workbench, and Adobe Creative Suite, which enhance both my development and design capabilities.

Currently seeking a software development internship, I am eager to apply my skills in frontend and backend development, software testing, and user-centered design to real-world projects. My past work in heuristic testing, accessibility, and UI asset creation has shaped my approach to building intuitive and efficient applications.

I thrive on learning new technologies, collaborating with teams, and solving complex problems. Let's connect—I'd love to explore opportunities in software development!🚀
